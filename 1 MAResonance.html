            <p>My work Resonance stems from a reflection on the relationship between the self and the
              external world.</p>
            <p>Everything in the world vibrates at a constant frequency, when the self is interacting with the
              external world, sometimes we find that there is a strong vibration and energy exchange between
              us and other people, things, objects or concepts, there seems to be a deep connection between
              us and it makes us feel healed, that is where resonance arises.</p>
            <div class="contentSpacing1"></div>
            <div class="contentSpacing1"></div>
            <p>Sound is the key to my work, as an extremely abstract and invisible form of existence is
              evidence of our interaction with the objective world, and at the same time, it strongly influences
              our lives, from the material to the spiritual. At the same time, my work is inextricably linked to
              shamanism, Zen, psychology and other elements related to healing.</p>
            <p>In many cultures of the ancient East, people used sound in rituals to create a connection
              between people and their environment for healing purposes. And in ancient Chinese poetry, the
              scene of pearls falling onto a plate is often used as a metaphor for the Zen-like imagery of rain
              falling on lotus leaves and the beautiful sound, so I sought to simulate this visual and auditory
              sense of spirituality and healing to express my thoughts.</p>
            <p>I have always tried to broaden the boundaries of jewellery and to explore more possibilities for
              objects. In this process, I tend to work by hand with old objects. I think that old objects, like
              people, have experienced time and have a connection with the world, they are not cold objects
              but warm beings, they seem to have their own characteristics, personalities and soul.</p>

            <p>The first piece is a candle holder with a string of pearls that look like melting candles and rings
               that can be worn and played with. It is more of an expression of the connection between the self and
                other things, more focused on the self and the inner world.</p>

            <p>The second piece is a pair of wine glasses connected at
              the bottom by a string of pearls and in the cups just like
              wine. People would clink their glasses to express their
              relationship with each other, and it also symbolises the
              resonance between two similar things with similar
              frequencies, a one-to-one relationship.</p>

            <p>The third piece is three jars, the strings of pearls connecting
              them can be moved from one jar to the other as if the
              contents of the jars were exchanged between them, they
              have similar parts but are actually different as if they were
              being discussed in a larger group relationship. Just like the
              intrinsic connections that exist between many people and
              things.</p>

            <p>Each of these pieces is separate and interconnected, telling its story in small scenes within
              the same general theme. I have fitted them with suitable boxes and made little pillows for
