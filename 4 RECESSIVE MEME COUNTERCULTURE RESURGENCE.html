            <p>E.O.Wilson, the founder of sociobiology, said that "genes control culture" , and memes, as
              the unit of cultural information transmission, develop in an organic way similar to the way
              genes are passed on. Explicit memes determine the externalization and prosperity of culture
              in different ages. As a genetic factor, recessive memes exist but do not necessarily appear.
              They do not gain the upper hand again until the right time comes. The culture they carry
              has been continuously reproduced, and each time after being reproduced appears similar
              but different from the last time. They show different styles in different times and
              environments. What is the same is that they all come from the same source and affect
              people's spiritual and material world at the same time. Starting from hippie culture and the
              counterculture behind it, this project studies the meme inheritance process under the
              appearance of retro culture becoming the fashion restoring and its influence on social
              development.</p>

              <p>Happiness has always been at the heart of the
                counterculture movement, and although it is
                often misunderstood as a deliberate act of
                mischief for the sake of their own happiness,
                their ultimate goal is to make everything happy
                and beautiful, and it's all done out of love.</p>
              <p>Love yourself and love the world. Just as The
                Buddha loved all living beings equally and
                selflessly, the rebellious people loved all living
                beings in the world. They longed for freedom
                and equality for all, and wanted harmony and
                stability in the natural resources and biological
                environment. They do what they can to make
                themselves a better person and the world a
                better place.</p>
              <p>Whether it was the rise of Buddhism, the hippie
                movement, or the new age, they sought to face
                life with optimism, to be happy every day, but
                also to do the most serious thing, not caring
                what other people thought, and to do what they
                thought was right.</p>

              <p>Flowers are one of the most common elements
                of the counterculture.</p>
              <p>During the counterculture movement around the
                1960s, hippies referred to themselves as "flower
                children," wearing garlands, holding bouquets,
                shouting slogans about love and peace, and
                sticking flowers into guns became iconic images
                in the course of history.</p>
              <p>Buddhist culture first emerged to reflect on the
                imperfections of the prevailing Hindu culture.
                The Buddha's life was also inextricably linked to
                the flower, which symbolizes beauty and
                holiness. Buddha was born, flowers bloom, walk
                seven steps, step by step birth lotus, into the
                taoist doctrine, heaven flowers praise. People
                also used precious flowers to feed the Buddha.</p>
              <p>In the counter-cultural movement at the present
                times, flowers were still immortal symbols, and
                people endowed flowers with beautiful images
                such as hope and eternity. No matter in variety
                or color, flowers or totems, they frequently
                appeared, indicating people's expectation for the
                present life and future development.</p>

              <p>In different counter-cultural movements,
                discipline is extremely important, because the
                process of pursuing and striving for better
                people and things is the process of spiritual
                practice. " to repair" is practice, correction, "to
                walk" means to make ways forward with
                "reading ten thousand books and traveling ten
                thousand miles".</p>
              <p>In contemporary society, the young people in
                the developed cities were generally under the
                dual pressure of economy and spirit, and a
                considerable number of them opposed the
                views of "success learning" and "elite
                education", and chose a seemingly rebellious
                and insecure lifestyle. They had no fixed
                residence or ‘9am to 5pm’ jobs, and some
                even lived "on the road" while traveling, just
                like hippies and monks.</p>
              <p>They learn Buddhist practices, such as asanas, 
                breathing techniques and meditation 
                techniques in yoga, as effective ways for them
                to adjust their physical and mental health and
                make continuous progress.</p>

              <p>In the expression and call at the same time
                also derived a lot of new artistic styles and

                the strongest and most far-reaching and
                lasting influence on people, constantly breaks

            <p>The hippie movement, which originated in the West in the 1960s, was a movement to express
              dissatisfaction with the real world by moving away from mainstream society. The hippies' strange
              clothes, rock music, psychedelics, communal life and artistic activities all highlighted their
              personality and rebellion, and these spiritual thoughts and behavior habits all had a profound
              influence on later generations. The hippies' boldly mixed style of dress was usually casual and
              colorful, with flowers, tassels, beads and tie-dye being the most common elements.</p>
            <p>The Buddhist culture of Nepal is the main source of hippie culture, whose essence in the initial rise
              is to rebel against the mainstream traditional culture. It is reflected in philosophical concepts, life
              attitudes, especially in clothing and accessories. The gemstone red coral, turquoise, lapis lazuli,
              agate, Tridacna, amber, crystal, pearl, colored glaze and other natural stones in Buddhist culture
              are also often worn by hippies.</p>
            <p>Until today, we can still find traces of hippie culture in our life. In addition to the hippie-style
              clothes worn by people who love the retro culture, some people joined in the array of
              counterculture, just like the hippies at the beginning, to fight against all the bad phenomena that
              need to be abandoned. They long for spiritual freedom and peace of life, and pursue a more
              perfect themselves and a more ideal world.</p>
